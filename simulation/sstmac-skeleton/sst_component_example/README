Make sure PATH is set for 'libsst++' compiler wrapper
and also for SST core 'sst' executable.
After running make, make sure SST_LIB_PATH is set so
sst-core can find libmacro.so from your SST/macro installation.
Once libtest.so is built, you should be able to run:

sst run.py

This will run the example and print debug output
